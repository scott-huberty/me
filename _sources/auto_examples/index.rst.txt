Educational "blogs" about Machine Learning, Signal Processing, and Software Engineering
=======================================================================================

I keep here a collection of educational "blog posts" that I've written over the years,
mostly to help students I teach and mentor to solidify their understanding of various
topics in machine learning, signal processing (and thus linear algebra and calculus),
and software engineering.

    <div class="sphx-glr-thumbcontainer" tooltip=" I really like ICA, and I use it all the time. But it&#x27;s not the most intuitive algorithm, and it is relatively niche compared to supervised learning. While teaching my students about it, I wanted to give them an example that was more intuitive than say, artifact removal in EEG data (after all, ICA can be used for much more than just artifact removal). So here&#x27;s my attempt at that, and also my attempt to pretend like I know what the kids are listening to these days.">
