    Great Data Science is built on great engineering.

The path from neuroscience to technology leadership is well-traveled. Consider the
creators of Scikit-Learn, who were all neuroscientists. They needed a robust machine
learning library to analyze their MRI and MEG data, and their solution became one of the
most widely-used tools in data science today.

This is no coincidence. Neuroscience demands mastery across multiple technical domains:

- To process **neuroimaging data**, you need a strong foundation in linear algebra, calculus, and signal processing.
- To handle **large datasets**, you need to be able to know how to write efficient code and manage memory.
- To **understand your data**, you need to design experiments and employ both classical statistical and modern machine learning techniques.
- To **communicate your findings**, you need to convey the compelling narrative in your data, for audiences ranging from technical specialists to practitioners.

    A neuroscientists intersection.

I am very grateful for my doctoral training in neuroscience, which provided hands-on
experience with each of these challenges. Now, at USC, I research at the intersection of
machine learning, scientific computing, and neuroscience.
