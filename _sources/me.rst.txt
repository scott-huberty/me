**Scott Huberty, Ph.D.**, is a data scientist and software engineer with a background in
computational biology and bioinformatics. 

Dr. Huberty completed his doctoral studies in Neuroscience from McGill University.
There, he received several awards and fellowships to support his research, including
a Google Summer of Code fellowship, and a Transforming Autism Care Consortium fellowship.
His disertation work focused on the development of new techniques for analyzing the
neural correlates of infant languge development.

Dr. Huberty is an active participant in open-source software. He has contributed to 
several open source projects, including the popular `MNE-Python <https://mne.tools/stable/index.html>`_
library for analyzing neurophysiological data, and `nibabies <https://nibabies.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
for processing infant MRI data. Outside of neuroscience, he has also contributed to
projects like `Shibuya <https://shibuya.lepture.com>`_, a static site generator to help
making good looking documentation for open-source projects easier.
