Bio
===

I am  a Post Doctoral Researcher at the University of Southern California.

I received my  doctoral training in the life sciences, and I  am an avid contributor to
all things Scientific Python. I am usually working on open source projects, and love to
make state-of-the-art tools available to the community.

.. tip::

    Traditionally I use my adoptive surname, Huberty, in my professional work,
    but I have also used my biological surname, Sibel, in my personal life. I am happy
    to answer to either name, and am only sharing this information to avoid
    confusion.
