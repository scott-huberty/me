While teaching my students about it, I wanted to give them an example that was more intuitive than say, artifact removal in EEG data (after all, ICA can be used for much more than just artifact removal). So here&#x27;s my attempt at that, and also my attempt to pretend like I know what the kids are listening to these days.">
