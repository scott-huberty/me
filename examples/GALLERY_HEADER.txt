ICA for musical source separation
=================================

Below is a gallery of examples that simulate the separation of musical sources from a recording
of "a band playing music", except we simulate the sources by mixing stems from the
10,000 gecs stems pack. The goal is to show how ICA can be used to separate musical sources
from a recording.
